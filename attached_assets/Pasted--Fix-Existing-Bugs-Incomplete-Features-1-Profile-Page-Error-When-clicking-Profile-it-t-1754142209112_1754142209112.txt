 Fix Existing Bugs & Incomplete Features
🔒 1. Profile Page Error

    When clicking "Profile", it throws an error.
    👉 Fix the bug and make the profile page accessible after login.

    Show user details (name, email, order history).

🛒 2. Add to Cart Not Working

    Clicking “Add to Cart” either throws an error or does nothing.
    👉 Fix the logic and ensure it:

        Adds the product to cart using Flask session

        Limits quantity: Min = 2 kg, Max = available stock

        Shows success or error message

        Displays updated cart count

❌ 3. Numeric Fields Accepting Text

    Input fields like Stock, Price, Quantity, etc., are allowing alphabets.
    👉 Fix all such fields with:

        Backend validation

        Frontend input type="number"

        Error message if invalid input is given

🌐 4. "Product Name (Nepali)" Auto Unicode Converter

    Make Product Name (Nepali) auto-convert English letters to Nepali Unicode.
    👉 Example: Typing “sungur” should convert to “सुँगुर”

        Use google_transliterate API or local transliteration mapping (offline version preferred)

⚙️ 5. Admin Dashboard: Actions Not Working

    Edit/Delete/Update buttons on product list are broken in admin dashboard
    👉 Fix all buttons to:

        Open modal or redirect to edit form

        Trigger product deletion confirmation

        Make all admin actions work without error

✨ Additions & Enhancements
🖼️ Product Photo Upload

    While adding/editing product:

        Let admin upload images (JPG/PNG)

        Show preview after upload

        Save to /static/uploads and store file path in DB

        Display images on user-facing product page

🛍 Cart System

    Add cart overview page (/cart)

    Allow update/remove items

    Fix checkout logic and place order

    Decrease stock after successful order

✅ Best Practices & Requirements

    Use Flask only (no JS/React/TS)

    Keep code clean and commented (I'm a beginner)

    Use proper form validation

    Use Unicode/Nepali script in product name

    Keep database and file system organized

    Make the platform fully mobile and desktop responsive
