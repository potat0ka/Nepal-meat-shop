# üçñ Nepal Meat Shop - Problem Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve the 128 reported problems in the trade application. The issues were primarily related to the migration from SQLAlchemy to MongoDB and inconsistent use of database models.

## Problems Identified
The 128 problems were caused by:
1. **Mixed Database Systems**: Application was using both SQLAlchemy and MongoDB simultaneously
2. **Outdated Route Registrations**: Old SQLAlchemy routes were still registered alongside MongoDB routes
3. **Inconsistent Model Usage**: Some files still referenced SQLAlchemy models after MongoDB migration
4. **Configuration Issues**: SQLAlchemy configurations were still present despite MongoDB migration

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Application Factory Updates (`app/__init__.py`)
- ‚úÖ Removed SQLAlchemy and Flask-Migrate imports
- ‚úÖ Removed SQLAlchemy initialization (`db = SQLAlchemy()`, `migrate = Migrate()`)
- ‚úÖ Updated blueprint registration to use MongoDB routes only:
  - Replaced `auth_bp` with `mongo_auth_bp`
  - Replaced `admin_bp` with `mongo_admin_bp`
  - Replaced `orders_bp` with `mongo_orders_bp`
  - Added `mongo_products_bp` and `mongo_main_bp`
- ‚úÖ Updated user loader function to use `mongo_db.find_user_by_id()`
- ‚úÖ Replaced SQLAlchemy initialization with MongoDB initialization

### 2. Route Updates (`app/routes/main.py`)
- ‚úÖ Updated imports to use MongoDB models (`MongoProduct`, `MongoCategory`)
- ‚úÖ Replaced SQLAlchemy queries with MongoDB queries:
  - `Product.query.filter_by()` ‚Üí `mongo_db.db.products.find()`
  - `Category.query.filter_by()` ‚Üí `mongo_db.get_all_categories()`
- ‚úÖ Updated search functionality to use MongoDB regex queries
- ‚úÖ Fixed API endpoints for product stock and categories
- ‚úÖ Updated health check to use MongoDB document counting

### 3. Payment Webhooks Updates (`app/routes/payment_webhooks.py`)
- ‚úÖ Removed SQLAlchemy imports (`from app.models.order import Order`, `from app import db`)
- ‚úÖ Updated `update_order_payment_status()` to use MongoDB only
- ‚úÖ Updated `get_order_id_by_number()` to use MongoDB only
- ‚úÖ Removed SQLAlchemy fallback code

### 4. Configuration Updates (`app/config/settings.py`)
- ‚úÖ Removed SQLAlchemy database configuration
- ‚úÖ Added MongoDB configuration (`MONGO_URI`, `MONGO_DBNAME`)
- ‚úÖ Updated all environment configurations (Development, Production, Testing)

### 5. Model File Cleanup
- ‚úÖ Removed `from app import db` imports from:
  - `app/models/order.py`
  - `app/models/analytics.py`
  - `app/models/user.py`
  - `app/models/product.py`

## Results
- ‚úÖ **Application Status**: Running successfully without errors
- ‚úÖ **Database**: Fully migrated to MongoDB Atlas
- ‚úÖ **Routes**: All using MongoDB-based implementations
- ‚úÖ **Configuration**: Clean MongoDB-only setup
- ‚úÖ **Code Quality**: Removed all SQLAlchemy references and conflicts

## Verification
- Application is accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
- No runtime errors in server logs
- All routes functioning properly with MongoDB backend
- Authentication system working with MongoDB user management

## Next Steps
The application is now fully migrated to MongoDB with all 128 problems resolved. The codebase is clean and consistent, using MongoDB for all database operations.
